SMET

**Slide 1: Title slide**

* Title: SMET: Semantic Mapping of CVE to ATT&CK
* Subtitle: A Tool for Improving Cybersecurity

**Slide 2: Introduction**

* What is SMET?
    * A tool that automatically maps Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
    * ATT&CK is a framework that describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities.
    * CVEs are identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities.
* Why is SMET important?
    * CVEs are often difficult to understand and interpret.
    * ATT&CK techniques provide a more detailed understanding of how vulnerabilities can be exploited.
    * SMET can help security analysts to map CVEs to ATT&CK techniques, which can improve their understanding of vulnerabilities and help them to identify appropriate countermeasures.

**Slide 3: How SMET works**

* SMET works by first extracting the attack vectors from the CVE description.
* An attack vector is a textual description of a malicious action that an attacker can perform.
* SMET then uses a semantic role labeling (SRL) model to identify the semantic roles of the entities in the attack vector.
* An SRL model is a machine learning model that can identify the relationships between entities in a sentence.
* Finally, SMET uses a technique called word embedding to create a vector representation of the attack vector.
* Word embedding is a process of converting words into vectors that capture their semantic meaning.
* The vector representation of the attack vector is then compared to the vector representations of the ATT&CK techniques to find the closest match.

**Slide 4: Benefits of using SMET**

* Improves understanding of vulnerabilities
* Helps identify appropriate countermeasures
* Automates the mapping of CVEs to ATT&CK techniques
* Improves the accuracy of vulnerability scanning tools
* Develops training materials for security analysts

**Slide 5: Limitations of SMET**

* Still under development
* Can be computationally expensive
* Requires a large amount of training data
* Accuracy can be affected by the quality of the CVE descriptions

**Slide 6: Accuracy of SMET**

* In a study, SMET was able to map 92% of the CVEs to the correct ATT&CK technique.
* However, the accuracy of SMET can be affected by the quality of the CVE descriptions.
* For example, if the CVE description is not clear or concise, SMET may not be able to map it to the correct ATT&CK technique.

**Slide 7: SMET and other security tools**

* SMET is not a silver bullet and should be used in conjunction with other security tools.
* Other security tools that can be used with SMET include:
    * Vulnerability scanning tools
    * Intrusion detection systems
    * Security information and event management (SIEM) systems

**Slide 8: SMET and other frameworks**

* SMET can be used to map CVEs to other frameworks, such as the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) framework.
* CAPEC is a framework that describes attack patterns that can be used by adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities.

**Slide 9: Future of SMET**

* SMET is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for the cybersecurity community.
* Future work on SMET could focus on improving the accuracy of the tool, reducing the computational cost, and expanding the coverage of the tool to include more CVEs.

**Slide 10: Conclusion**

* SMET is a promising tool that can help security analysts to improve their understanding of vulnerabilities and to identify appropriate countermeasures.
* SMET is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for the cybersecurity community.

**SMET**

SMET is a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to semantic mapping of CVE to ATT&CK. SMET was developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Maryland, College Park.

**SRL**

SRL is a natural language processing technique that can be used to extract the semantic roles of words and phrases in a sentence. In the context of SMET, SRL is used to extract the attack vectors from the CVE description. An attack vector is a textual description of a malicious action that an attacker can perform. Some examples of attack vectors include “exploit a vulnerability to gain access to a network,” “execute code on a victim machine,” or “send data to a C2 server.”

**Attack BERT**

Attack BERT is a BERT model that has been fine-tuned on a dataset of attack vectors. This means that Attack BERT has learned to identify the important features of attack vectors and to generate embeddings that are more relevant to the task of semantic mapping of CVE to ATT&CK.

**Logical Regression**

Logical regression is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to predict a categorical variable based on a set of features. In the context of SMET, logical regression can be used to predict the ATT&CK technique that is associated with a given CVE.

**How SMET works**

SMET works by first using SRL to extract the attack vectors from the CVE description. Then, SMET uses Attack BERT to generate embeddings for the attack vectors. These embeddings are then used as features in a logical regression model to predict the ATT&CK technique.

**Advantages of SMET**

SMET has several advantages over other approaches to semantic mapping of CVE to ATT&CK, including:

* It does not require a manually annotated dataset, which makes it more scalable and adaptable to new CVEs and ATT&CK techniques.
* It is more accurate than previous approaches, achieving an accuracy of 90%.
* It is more efficient, taking only a few milliseconds to map a CVE to ATT&CK techniques.

**Applications of SMET**

SMET can be used to improve cybersecurity in a variety of ways, including:

* Helping security teams to understand the risks posed by vulnerabilities.
* Prioritizing vulnerability remediation efforts.
* Developing effective mitigation strategies.
* Automating the process of vulnerability management.

**Conclusion**

SMET is a promising new approach to semantic mapping of CVE to ATT&CK. SMET is accurate, efficient, and scalable, making it a valuable tool for improving cybersecurity.



Preprocessing: The first step in SRL is to preprocess the text. This involves removing stop words, punctuation, and other noise from the text. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python.
Tokenization: The next step is to tokenize the text, which means breaking it down into individual words or phrases. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as the NLTK word_tokenize() function.
Dependency parsing: The third step is to perform dependency parsing on the text. This involves identifying the syntactic relationships between the words in the text. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as the Stanford CoreNLP parser.
Semantic role labeling: The fourth and final step is to perform semantic role labeling on the text. This involves assigning a semantic role to each word in the text. The semantic roles that are used in SRL are typically defined in a lexicon or a knowledge base.
The following are some of the most common semantic roles that are used in SRL:

Agent: The entity that performs the action.
Action: The action that is performed.
Object: The entity that is affected by the action.
Recipient: The entity that receives the action.
Instrument: The tool or object that is used to perform the action.
Location: The place where the action takes place.
Time: The time when the action takes place.



Sure, here are the steps involved in semantic role labeling (SRL) in more detail:

1. **Preprocessing:** The first step in SRL is to preprocess the text. This involves removing stop words, punctuation, and other noise from the text. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python.
2. **Tokenization:** The next step is to tokenize the text, which means breaking it down into individual words or phrases. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as the NLTK word_tokenize() function.
3. **Dependency parsing:** The third step is to perform dependency parsing on the text. This involves identifying the syntactic relationships between the words in the text. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as the Stanford CoreNLP parser.
4. **Semantic role labeling:** The fourth and final step is to perform semantic role labeling on the text. This involves assigning a semantic role to each word in the text. The semantic roles that are used in SRL are typically defined in a lexicon or a knowledge base.

The following are some of the most common semantic roles that are used in SRL:

* **Recipient:** The entity that receives the action.
* **Instrument:** The tool or object that is used to perform the action.
* **Location:** The place where the action takes place.
* **Time:** The time when the action takes place.

The semantic roles that are assigned to the words in the text are used to represent the meaning of the sentence. This representation can then be used for a variety of tasks, such as machine translation, question answering, and natural language inference.

I hope this explanation is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.





Sure, here are the semantic role labeling (SRL) steps in the context of SMET (Semantic Mapping of CVE to ATT&CK) in more details:

1. **Preprocessing:** The first step is to preprocess the CVE description. This involves removing stop words, punctuation, and other noise from the text.
2. **Tokenization:** The next step is to tokenize the text, which means breaking it down into individual words or phrases.
3. **Named entity recognition:** The third step is to perform named entity recognition (NER) on the tokens. This involves identifying the named entities in the text, such as people, organizations, and locations.
4. **Coreference resolution:** The fourth step is to perform coreference resolution on the tokens. This involves identifying the references to the same entity in the text.
5. **SRL tagging:** The fifth and final step is to perform SRL tagging on the tokens. This involves assigning a semantic role to each token. The semantic roles that are used in SMET are:

    * **Agent:** The entity that performs the action.
    * **Action:** The action that is performed.
    * **Object:** The entity that is affected by the action.

The SRL tagging step is the most important step in the SMET approach. It allows SMET to identify the important semantic roles in the text, and it allows SMET to generate a concise and accurate representation of the attack.

The following is an example of how SRL tagging can be used to extract an attack vector from a CVE description:

**CVE description:** A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows Print Spooler service due to improper handling of specially crafted Print Spooler requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**SRL tagging:**

    * Agent: attacker
    * Action: exploit
    * Object: vulnerability

The SRL tagging step identifies the following semantic roles in the CVE description:

    * Agent: The attacker is the entity that performs the action.
    * Action: The action is to exploit the vulnerability.
    * Object: The object is the vulnerability.

The attacker, action, and object semantic roles can be combined to form an attack vector:

**Attack vector:** attacker exploits vulnerability

The attack vector captures the essence of the attack in a concise and accurate way. It can be used to predict the ATT&CK technique with high accuracy.

I hope this explanation is helpful!






Sure, here is a presentation on the semantic role labeling steps in the context of SMET (Semantic Mapping of CVE to ATT&CK) in the form of a deck:


## Semantic Role Labeling in SMET

* **Preprocessing:**
    * Remove stop words, punctuation, and other noise from the text.
    * This is important because stop words do not add any meaning to the text and can actually make it more difficult to extract the semantic roles.
* **Tokenization:**
    * Break the text down into individual words or phrases.
    * This is important because the SRL tagging algorithm needs to be able to identify the individual words and phrases in the text in order to assign the correct semantic roles.
* **Named entity recognition:**
    * Identify named entities in the text, such as people, organizations, and locations.
    * This is important because the SRL tagging algorithm needs to be able to identify the named entities in the text in order to assign the correct semantic roles.
* **Coreference resolution:**
    * Identify the references to the same entity in the text.
    * This is important because the SRL tagging algorithm needs to be able to identify the references to the same entity in the text in order to assign the correct semantic roles.
* **SRL tagging:**
    * Assign a semantic role to each token.
    * This is the most important step because it is the step that extracts the semantic roles from the text.

**Example:**

CVE description: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows Print Spooler service due to improper handling of specially crafted Print Spooler requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**SRL tagging:**

    * **Agent:** The attacker is the entity that performs the action.
    * **Action:** The action is to exploit the vulnerability.
    * **Object:** The object is the vulnerability.

**Attack vector:** attacker exploits vulnerability

**Conclusion:**

* Semantic role labeling is an important step in the SMET approach to semantic mapping of CVE to ATT&CK.
* It allows SMET to identify the important semantic roles in the text, and it allows SMET to generate a concise and accurate representation of the attack.
* The attack vector can be used to predict the ATT&CK technique with high accuracy.

Sure, here is a presentation on how logical regression can be used to do attack mapping in the context of SMET:

## Logical Regression for Attack Mapping in SMET

* **Logical regression:** A statistical model that can be used to predict the probability of an event occurring based on a set of known factors.
* **Attack mapping:** The process of identifying the ATT&CK techniques that are associated with a particular CVE description.
* **SMET:** A tool that can be used to automatically identify ATT&CK techniques in CVE descriptions.

Here are the steps involved in using logical regression to do attack mapping in SMET:

1. **Collect a dataset of CVE descriptions and ATT&CK techniques.** This dataset can be created by manually pairing CVE descriptions with ATT&CK techniques, or by using a tool like SMET to automatically identify ATT&CK techniques in CVE descriptions.
2. **Train a logical regression model on the dataset.** The model will learn to predict the probability of a CVE description being associated with a particular ATT&CK technique based on the factors that are present in the CVE description.
3. **Use the model to predict the ATT&CK techniques that are associated with new CVE descriptions.** This can be done by passing the new CVE descriptions to the model and seeing which ATT&CK techniques have the highest predicted probability.


Here are some of the benefits of using logical regression for attack mapping in SMET:

* **Simple and easy to understand:** Logical regression is a relatively simple model that is easy to understand and interpret. This makes it a good choice for organizations that are new to attack mapping or that do not have a lot of data scientists on staff.
* **Efficient:** Logical regression is a relatively efficient model, which makes it scalable to large datasets. This is important for organizations that have a large number of CVE descriptions to map.
* **Robust to noisy data:** Logical regression is relatively robust to noisy data. This means that it can still produce accurate predictions even if the CVE descriptions are not perfect.


Here are some of the limitations of using logical regression for attack mapping in SMET:

* **Not as accurate as other models:** Logical regression is not as accurate as some other machine learning models, such as neural networks. This is because it is a simpler model that does not take into account as many factors.
* **Not as good at handling complex relationships:** Logical regression is not as good at handling complex relationships between factors. This can be a problem for CVE descriptions that contain multiple factors that contribute to the attack.


Overall, logical regression is a good choice for attack mapping in SMET when accuracy is not the most important factor. It is a simple, efficient, and robust model that can be used to predict the ATT&CK techniques that are associated with new CVE descriptions.





Introduction:
SMET is a tool that can be used to automatically map CVE descriptions to ATT&CK techniques.
ATT&CK is a framework that describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that attackers use to compromise systems.
SMET can be used to help organizations understand the security risks posed by CVEs and to prioritize their remediation efforts.
How SMET works: SMET first uses a semantic role labeling (SRL) model to extract the semantic roles of words and phrases in a CVE description. Then, SMET uses a machine learning model to map the semantic roles to ATT&CK techniques. The machine learning model is trained on a dataset of CVE descriptions and ATT&CK techniques.




Step 1: Semantic role labeling (SRL): SRL is the process of identifying the semantic roles of words and phrases in a sentence. The semantic roles of a sentence are the relationships between the words and phrases in the sentence. For example, in the sentence "The attacker exploited a vulnerability in the web server," the semantic roles are "agent" (the attacker), "action" (exploited), and "object" (the vulnerability).
Step 2: Attack Bert: Attack Bert is a BERT-based model that has been fine-tuned on a dataset of CVE descriptions and ATT&CK techniques. BERT is a natural language processing model that has been shown to be very effective at understanding the meaning of words and phrases in a sentence. Attack Bert is a variant of BERT that has been fine-tuned on a dataset of CVE descriptions and ATT&CK techniques. This means that Attack Bert is specifically designed to understand the language used in CVE descriptions and ATT&CK techniques.
Step 3: Machine learning: The machine learning model in SMET is trained on a dataset of CVE descriptions and ATT&CK techniques. The model learns to map the semantic roles of words and phrases in a CVE description to ATT&CK techniques. This means that the model can predict which ATT&CK techniques are likely to be used in an attack that is described by a particular CVE description.
Step 4: Logical regression: Logical regression is a statistical model that can be used to predict the probability of a CVE description being associated with a particular ATT&CK technique. This means that logical regression can be used to predict the most likely ATT&CK techniques for a given CVE description.



Sure, here is a final speaker notes that combines the previous two contents and includes an example:

**Semantic role labeling (SRL) in the context of SMET**

SRL is a natural language processing technique that identifies the semantic roles of the words and phrases in a sentence. In the context of SMET, SRL can be used to identify the semantic roles of the words and phrases in a CVE description. This information can then be used to extract ATT&CK vectors from the CVE description.

**An ATT&CK vector** is a description of how an attacker can exploit a vulnerability to gain access to a system.

To extract ATT&CK vectors from a CVE description using SRL, we can follow these steps:

1. **Pre-processing:** The first step is to perform pre-processing on the CVE description. This includes tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and coreference resolution.
2. **Semantic role labeling:** The second step is to perform semantic role labeling on the pre-processed CVE description. This involves identifying the semantic roles of the words and phrases in the CVE description.
3. **Extracting ATT&CK vectors:** The third step is to extract ATT&CK vectors from the semantic roles of the CVE description. This can be done by looking for patterns in the semantic roles that match known ATT&CK vectors.

**Example:**

The following is an example of how SRL can be used to extract ATT&CK vectors from a CVE description:

* **CVE Description:**

> The attacker exploited a vulnerability in the web server to gain access to the system.

* **Pre-processing:**

The pre-processing steps would first tokenize the CVE description, part-of-speech tag the tokens, identify named entities, and resolve coreferences. This would result in the following:

    * The
    * attacker
    * exploited
    * a
    * vulnerability
    * in
    * the
    * web
    * server
    * to
    * gain
    * access
    * to
    * the
    * system

* **Semantic role labeling:**

The semantic role labeling step would then assign semantic roles to the words and phrases in the CVE description. This would result in the following:

    * **Agent:** The attacker
    * **Action:** Exploited
    * **Object:** The vulnerability



    Findings: Command Line Injection, Reconnaissance, and Privilege Escalation via Azure CLI
Discovery of VM Scale Set:

The attacker utilized the Azure CLI to enumerate resources within the subscription.
Command executed: az vmss list --output table
This allowed the attacker to identify the presence and details of a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) deployed within the environment.
Command Line Injection and Execution of Remote Shell with Elevated Privileges:

The attacker exploited a command line injection vulnerability to execute commands on a VM instance within the scale set.
Command executed: az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <ResourceGroup> --name <ScaleSetName> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id <InstanceID> --scripts "whoami"
This injection allowed the attacker to gain a remote shell with root privileges on the VM instance, indicating a severe escalation of privileges.
Acquisition of Managed Identity Token:

The attacker proceeded to query the OAuth2 endpoint to obtain a managed identity token.
Command executed (example using a curl request within the VM's shell): curl 'http://localhost:50342/oauth2/token?resource=https://management.azure.com/&api-version=2019-08-01' -H Metadata:true
The token obtained was associated with the managed identity assigned to the VM, granting the attacker access to further Azure resources and services.
Privilege Escalation:

The attacker successfully escalated privileges by leveraging the managed identity token.
With this token, the attacker was able to perform actions and access resources with the permissions associated with the managed identity, potentially leading to further compromise within the Azure environment.

### Penetration Testing Report

#### Findings: Unrestricted File Upload and Metadata Tampering in Azure Blob Storage

- **Unrestricted File Upload**:
  - The attacker, with access to Azure Blob Storage, can upload files of any type through both the web interface and Azure CLI.
  - Commands executed for file upload:
    ```sh
    az storage blob upload --container-name <ContainerName> --file <FilePath> --name <BlobName>
    ```
  - There are no restrictions on file type extensions, allowing the upload of potentially harmful files, including malicious scripts.
