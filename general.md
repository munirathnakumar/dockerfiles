Your objective is to ensure the security of both the Terraform infrastructure code and the deployed application code by identifying vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other security issues.

**Requirements:**

1. **Source Code and Pipeline Integration:**
   - Fork or clone the provided three-tier application source code repository from https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat.
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a service like AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps, or any other CI/CD tool of your choice.
   - Integrate the three-tier application source code repository into the CI/CD pipeline.

2. **DevSecOps Scanning Processes:**
   - Implement the following security scanning processes into the CI/CD pipeline:
     - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Analyze the application source code for security vulnerabilities and coding best practices.
     - Dependency Checking: Scan for any vulnerable dependencies or libraries used in the application.
     - Password Scanning: Check the source code and Terraform scripts for hardcoded passwords or sensitive information.
     - Container Scanning (if applicable): Analyze Docker container images for known vulnerabilities.
   - Utilize any open-source scanning tools of your choice to perform these security scans.

3. **Pipeline Configuration:**
   - Configure the CI/CD pipeline to trigger upon approving a pull request in the source code repository.
   - Ensure that the pipeline is structured in a way that the build process halts in case of any high-severity vulnerability findings.

4. **Scan Report Management:**
   - Configure the CI/CD pipeline to generate detailed scan reports for each security scanning process.
   - Ensure that all scan reports are easily accessible and well-documented.
   - Store the scan reports in a designated directory within the application source code repository.

**Deliverables:**
- Updated CI/CD pipeline configuration integrating the three-tier application source code and DevSecOps scanning processes.
- Documentation outlining the setup instructions, including details on integrated security scanning processes and how to access and interpret scan reports.

**Additional Information:**
- The goal is to automate security scanning processes to ensure the security of both the application code and the underlying infrastructure.
- Utilize any open-source scanning tools that you deem appropriate for the task.
- Ensure that the CI/CD pipeline is robust and follows standard practices in CI/CD and DevSecOps.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Successful integration of the three-tier application source code into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Implementation of effective DevSecOps scanning processes, including SAST, dependency checking, password scanning, and container scanning (if applicable).
- Proper configuration of the pipeline to trigger upon approving a pull request.
- Compliance with security best practices and adherence to DevSecOps principles.
- Clarity and completeness of documentation, especially regarding setup instructions and scan report management.
