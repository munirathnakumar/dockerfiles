Abusive Use Case,Steps to Implement,Success Criteria,Failure Criteria
Denial of Service (DoS) Attack,1. Create Azure Function App <br> 2. Implement HTTP Trigger Function <br> 3. Flood the function with a high volume of HTTP requests simultaneously,- Function becomes unresponsive or unavailable due to excessive load. <br> - Target system experiences performance degradation or downtime.,- Function continues to respond to requests but with significantly degraded performance. <br> - Azure platform detects and mitigates the DoS attack.
Resource Exhaustion,1. Create Azure Function App <br> 2. Implement an infinite loop or recursive function <br> 3. Trigger the function repeatedly,"- Function consumes excessive CPU or memory resources, leading to resource exhaustion. <br> - Other functions or services on the same platform are affected.",- Azure platform detects and terminates the function due to excessive resource consumption. <br> - Function crashes or returns errors due to resource constraints.
Data Scraping Abuse,1. Create Azure Function App <br> 2. Implement Web Scraping Logic <br> 3. Scraping data from websites without permission,- Large volumes of data are successfully scraped from target websites. <br> - Scraped data is stored or used for malicious purposes.,"- Target websites detect and block the scraping activity, rendering the function ineffective. <br> - Legal action is taken against the function owner."
Brute Force Attack,1. Create Azure Function App <br> 2. Implement an authentication function <br> 3. Perform repeated login attempts with different credentials,- Function successfully identifies valid login credentials through brute force. <br> - Unauthorized access is gained to the target system.,- Function successfully defends against brute force attacks by implementing rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms. <br> - Azure platform detects and mitigates the attack.
Malware Distribution,1. Create Azure Function App <br> 2. Host malicious files or scripts <br> 3. Distribute links to these files through the function,- Malicious files are successfully hosted and distributed to unsuspecting users. <br> - Malware infects target systems and performs unauthorized actions.,"- Function is reported or detected by security systems, leading to its suspension or termination. <br> - Legal action is taken against the function owner."
